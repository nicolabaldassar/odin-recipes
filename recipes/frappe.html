    <p>Delicious green tea powder blended into a creamy drink
        that's better than Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino®. I
        use DoMatcha as it is the best quality around; it is
        expensive, however, and a little goes a long way.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon matcha green tea powder, or more to taste</li>
        <li>5 ice cubes, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla-flavored syrup (such as Torani®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon whipped cream, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine milk, matcha green tea powder, ice, and
            vanilla syrup, respectively in a blender; blend to

        </li>
        <li>
            Serve with whipped cream on top.
