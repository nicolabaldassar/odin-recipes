    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup prepared lemonade</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen cranberries, thawed</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen blueberries, thawed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease
            12 muffin cups.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring water and salt to a boil; add oats and cook until
            thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Blend lemonade, cranberries, blueberries, and 3
            tablespoons sugar in a blender until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour 1 cup of the lemonade mixture into a large bowl;
            add 1 cup sugar and the cooked oats and stir until
            just-combined. Discard remaining lemonade mixture or
            save for another batch.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a small
            bowl; add to the lemonade mixture and stir until batter
            is smooth. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups to
            about 2/3-full.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about
            20 minutes. Cool muffins in tins for 5 minutes
            before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
