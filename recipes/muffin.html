        <h2 class="intro">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease
                12 muffin cups.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bring water and salt to a boil; add oats and cook until
                thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Blend lemonade, cranberries, blueberries, and 3
                tablespoons sugar in a blender until smooth.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Pour 1 cup of the lemonade mixture into a large bowl;
                add 1 cup sugar and the cooked oats and stir until
                just-combined. Discard remaining lemonade mixture or
                save for another batch.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Mix flour, baking powder, and baking soda in a small
                bowl; add to the lemonade mixture and stir until batter
                is smooth. Pour batter into prepared muffin cups to
                about 2/3-full.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven until lightly browned, about
                20 minutes. Cool muffins in tins for 5 minutes
                before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.
